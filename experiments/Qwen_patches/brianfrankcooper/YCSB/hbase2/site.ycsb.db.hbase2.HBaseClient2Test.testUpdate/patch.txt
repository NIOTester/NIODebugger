Certainly! The test method `testUpdate` is non-idempotent due to the fact that the previous execution already performs the same action. Here's the modified version that makes the test idempotent:

```java

public void setUp() throws Exception {
  client.cleanup();
  setUp(new Properties());
}
```

In this fix, the client is reset to ensure before test execution to ensure an update can be performed.
